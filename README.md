# PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE
The goal of this project is to implement predictive maintenance, also known as condition-based maintenance. This approach involves continuously monitoring the performance and condition of equipment during regular operations to reduce the likelihood of unexpected breakdowns.
## Dataset and Variables:
<br>•	The analysis uses a Kaggle dataset with 10,000 entries.
<br>•	The target variable is "failure type," which likely represents different categories of equipment failures.
<br>•	Several independent variables are used to predict failure types:
<br>o	"Product ID": Identifies the product.
<br>o	"Type": Indicates the type of equipment.
<br>o	"Air temperature [K]": Air temperature in Kelvin.
<br>o	"Process temperature [K]": Process temperature in Kelvin.
<br>o	"Rotational speed [rpm]": Rotational speed in revolutions per minute.
<br>o	"Torque [Nm]": Torque in Newton-meters.
<br>o	"Tool wear [min]": Accumulated tool wear in minutes.
<br>o	"Target": The target variable representing the failure type.
## Regression Models:
<br>•	Multiple Linear Regression: This model attempts to establish a linear relationship between the target variable (failure type) and multiple independent variables. In this context, it may not capture complex nonlinear patterns well.
<br>•	Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression extends linear regression by introducing polynomial terms of independent variables to capture nonlinear relationships.
<br>•	Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR is a regression technique that uses support vector machines to find the best-fit curve while allowing for a margin of error.
<br>•	Decision Tree Regression: Decision trees split the dataset into subsets based on the values of independent variables to make predictions. They can capture complex relationships.
<br>•	Random Forest Regression: Random forests are an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
## Model Evaluation:
<br>•	The project evaluates model performance using the R-squared (R2) metric. R2 measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that the model can explain. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model fit.
<br>•	The statement suggests that the Random Forest Regression model achieved the highest R2 value, approximately 80%, indicating it explains a significant portion of the variance in failure types.
<br>•	The Decision Tree model had an R2 of 62%, indicating it also explained a substantial portion of the variance.
<br>•	Support Vector Regression achieved an R2 of 58%, Polynomial Regression 52%, and Multiple Linear Regression only 27%, suggesting lower predictive performance for these models.
## Interpretation:
<br>•	The R2 values provide insight into the predictive power of each regression model. Higher R2 values indicate better predictive performance.
<br>•	An R2 of 80% for the Random Forest model suggests that it's a strong performer in predicting failure types based on the given variables.
<br>•	It's important to note that while Random Forest and Decision Tree models are performing well, they might require further evaluation and fine-tuning, and real-world applications may need additional data and features for even more accurate predictions.
<br>In practice, predictive maintenance projects can help companies reduce equipment downtime and maintenance costs by addressing issues before they lead to failures. Proper model evaluation and ongoing monitoring are essential to ensure the reliability of these predictive maintenance systems.
